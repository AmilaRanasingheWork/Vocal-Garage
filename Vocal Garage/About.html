            <p>Vocal Garage was created in January 2022. Founders <strong>Olga Lewis, Emily Wills, Anastasia Owain</strong>
                had one intention in mind: to make sure that rock genre would keep its significance in music. 
                They met each other while studying to play piano and guitar in Royal Academy of Music. Their passion for 
                rock genre cemented their journey to form Vocal Garage. Join our 
                journey and share our passion to keep rock genre relevant!</p>
